# phaser-project-ts
A basic game project template using TS-Parcel-Phaser

This includes:
* `typescript` for coding.
* `eslint` for style and format.
* `jest` for testing and coverage.
* `husky` for commit hooks.
* `parcel` to do the live server, transpiling of the code and building.
* `Phaser.JS` as the main game engine.

# Usage
Just clone the damn thing, run `npm install` and start hacking 😊

# Scripts

* `npm run eslint` runs the linter
* `npm run server` runs parcel to pack everything and launches a browser.
